    <h2>WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?</h2>
     <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. 

    </p>

    <h2>WHAT ARE THE USES FOR AI?</h2>
     <P>AI is ubiquitous today, used to recommend what you should buy next online, to understanding what you say to virtual assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, to recognise who and what is in a photo, to spot spam, or detect credit card fraud.

    </P>

    <h2>HOW IS AI USED?</h2>
     <p>Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories: 
       . Narrow AI: Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence operates within a limited context and is a simulation of human intelligence. Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well and while these machines may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence. 
       . Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem. 
     <h2> Narrow Artificial Intelligence</h2>
       <p>Narrow AI is all around us and is easily the most successful realization of artificial intelligence to date. With its focus on performing specific tasks, Narrow AI has experienced numerous breakthroughs in the last decade that have had "significant societal benefits and have contributed to the economic vitality of the nation," according to "Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence," a 2016 report released by the Obama Administration. 
        A few examples of Narrow AI include: 
         .Googlesearch
         .Image recognition software
         .Siri, Alexa and other personal assistants
         .Self-driving cars
         .IBM's Watson
        </p> 
     <h2>Artificial General Intelligence </h2>
      <p>The creation of a machine with human-level intelligence that can be applied to any task is the Holy Grail for many AI researchers, but the quest for AGI has been fraught with difficulty. 
         The search for a "universal algorithm for learning and acting in any environment," (Russel and Norvig 27) isn't new, but time hasn't eased the difficulty of essentially creating a machine with a full set of cognitive abilities. 
         AGI has long been the muse of dystopian science fiction, in which super-intelligent robots overrun humanity, but experts agree it's not something we need to worry about anytime soon.

    <h2>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF AI? </h2>
     <P>There are four types of artificial intelligence: reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness.
